# üì° OFDM Modulation Classification with Deep Learning

üìå Overview

This project presents a comprehensive pipeline for classifying Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation schemes using various deep learning architectures. We explore and compare multiple approaches ranging from spectrogram-based CNNs to hybrid CNN-LSTM models, using raw I/Q signals as well as engineered features like magnitude and phase.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

Framework: PyTorch

GPU Acceleration: CUDA-enabled (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3060)

All models are trained on .h5 files containing raw OFDM signals

# üß∑ Dataset Structure & Label Mapping

Dataset is structured by modulation class folders:

BPSK_BPSK, BPSK_QPSK, BPSK_8PSK, QPSK_QPSK, QPSK_BPSK, QPSK_8PSK

Each class is assigned an integer label from 0 to 5

# üìÇ Data Preprocessing

Raw I/Q Loader

Parses complex signal from .h5 files

Splits signal into 1024-sample segments

Extracts In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) channels: [2, 1024]

Spectrogram Loader

Converts I/Q signal into complex form and applies Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)

Extracts magnitude spectrogram [Freq x Time]

Normalizes values for stability

I/Q + Mag/Phase Loader

Adds engineered features:

I, Q, Magnitude, and Phase ‚Üí [1024, 4]

# üìä I/Q Signal Visualization

Visual plots of individual I and Q components were used to validate signal integrity and variation across classes.

# üåà Spectrogram Analysis

Time-frequency spectrograms were generated using STFT to highlight frequency evolution in modulated signals. These were input to CNN-based models.
