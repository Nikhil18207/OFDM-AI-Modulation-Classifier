🚀 OFDM Modulation Classification using Deep Learning with Noise-Aware Evaluation & Spectrogram Visual Insights

#🎯 Objective
The goal is to develop an AI system capable of:

Automatically classifying modulation schemes (e.g., BPSK_BPSK, QPSK_8PSK) from raw wireless OFDM signals.
Operating effectively across a wide range of Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs), from -20 dB to +20 dB.
Providing visual and confidence-based insights for each signal segment, ensuring both accuracy and explainability.

#📦 Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized as follows:

Folders: Each represents a modulation pair, e.g.:
BPSK_8PSK/
QPSK_BPSK/
...


Files: .h5 files labeled with SNR values, e.g.:
BPSK_8PSK/-10dB.h5
BPSK_8PSK/0dB.h5
BPSK_8PSK/6dB.h5


File Content:
A single complex signal (I/Q data).
Shape: [4194304, 1], dtype: complex64.


#🧪 Step 1: Preprocessing
Signal Segmentation

The long I/Q signal is divided into 4096 chunks, each containing 1024 points.

Spectrogram Transformation

Each chunk is converted into a spectrogram using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
Resulting shape: 128xN (frequency x time) image, suitable for CNN input.

Label Mapping

Labels are extracted from file/folder names, e.g., 'BPSK_8PSK' → 2.

#🧠 Step 2: Model - Hybrid CNN + LSTM
The model architecture combines:

CNN Layers:
Extract spatial patterns from spectrogram (frequency-time features).


LSTM Layers:
Capture temporal sequence patterns across time bins.


Fully Connected Layer:
Outputs one of the 6 modulation classes.
This hybrid structure excels at sequence-aware classification for modulation recognition.

#🏋️ Step 3: Training

Dataset Split: 80% training, 20% validation.
Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss.
Optimizer: Adam.
Epochs: 30.
Metrics: Accuracy, segment-wise prediction.
Performance:
Accuracy improved from ~63% to ~85% over 30 epochs.
Demonstrated generalization even in noisy conditions.



#🧠 Step 4: Real-Time Classification & Deployment
Functionality
Users can upload a .h5 signal file (e.g., 6dB.h5), and the system:

Segments the signal.
Classifies each chunk.
Outputs the majority-voted predicted modulation.
